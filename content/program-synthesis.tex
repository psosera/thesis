\todo{An overview of the field of program synthesis.  Areas we need to highlight:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Property-based specification.
    \item Example-based specification.
    \item Solver-based approaches.
    \item Type-theoretic inspired approaches.
    \item Logic-programming inspired approaches.
    \item Related problems in type theory.
  \end{itemize}%
