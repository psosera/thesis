So far, we have considered adding a variety of basic types to \lsyn{}.
While these types allow us to synthesize programs that more closely match those found in actual functional programming languages, they have not significantly changed the expressiveness of our core language.
Next we will consider adding recursion to \lsyn{} which greatly increases its expressiveness.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$μ$}{μ} Types}

One way to express recursion within a typed lambda calculus is with $μ$-types.
The type $μα.\,τ$ binds a recursive occurrence of a type to the type variable $α$ which appears in its definition $τ$.
