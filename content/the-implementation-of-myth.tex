In \autoref{ch:implementation} we evolved the synthesis judgment of \mlsyn{} into an efficient synthesis procedure.
This procedure went through several iterations in the chapter, so we summarize the final product here which we implemented directly in our prototype program synthesis tool, \myth{}.

Our synthesis procedure consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A \emph{refinement tree generation algorithm},
  \item A \emph{relevant term generation algorithm}, and
  \item An iterative procedure that, given a synthesis problem, synthesizes programs according to a set of \emph{search metrics}.
  \end{enumerate}

\todo{Copy-paste the three bits of procedure here.}
