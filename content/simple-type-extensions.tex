\lsyn{} is a core calculus for program synthesis with types.
As such, it only contains the bare essence of a typed, functional programming language, namely lambdas and function application.
However, one of the appeals of the type-directed synthesis approach is that we derive the synthesis judgment directly from the type checking judgment; we merely flip its inputs and outputs.
In other words, type checking immediately gives us insight into program synthesis for new types!

In this chapter, we explore the process of integrating new types into \lsyn{} by considering a number of additional basic types: products, sums, and records.
By playing this game with the type system of flipping inputs and outputs, we learn how to generate terms and refine examples of these types.
In some cases, this is sufficient to synthesize this type within \lsyn{}.
However in other cases, especially with more complex types that we consider in future chapters, we must do additional work to properly synthesize programs of those types.
