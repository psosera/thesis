\todo{To demonstrate the extensibility of the system, we extend $Î»_{syn}$ with types and records (in anticipation of recursive data types in the next section).
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Add tuples to the language, discuss focusing, other challenges.
    \item Add records to the language, discuss challenges.
    \item Finally add algebraic data types and discuss more challenges.
  \end{itemize}%
