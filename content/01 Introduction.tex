\todo{Introducing the thesis.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Program synthesis makes programming more accessible.
    \item Precise typing information refines the possible set of programs dramatically.
    \item Current program synthesis techniques are inherently first-order and unable to deal with advanced programming features like higher-order functions and recursion.
    \item Type-theoretic approaches to program synthesis, grounded in proof search, get over these hurdles.
    \item Furthermore, type-theoretic program synthesis promises to allow us to unleash the whole of type theory upon synthesis.
      Any application of type theory towards verification can become a synthesizer of programs that are correct-by-construction!
    \item Finally, type-theoretic program synthesis unites efforts in the verification and type theory communities to automate the construction of programs.
      Thanks to Curry-Howard, we can recognize the similarities between the different synthesis problems identified in these communities and begin to unite them under a common framework.
